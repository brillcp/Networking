# Networking ⚡️

Networking is a lightweight but powerful network framework written in Swift by [Viktor Gidlöf](https://viktorgidlof.com).
It uses `Combine`, `URLSession` and `dataTaskPublishers` for network calls and is made up of three components:

+ [`Network.Service`](Sources/Networking/Service/NetworkService.swift)
+ [`ServerConfig`](Sources/Networking/ServerConfig/ServerConfig.swift)
